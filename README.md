CodeCrafters Git Challenge â€“ C# Implementation
This repository contains my complete solution for the CodeCrafters Git Challenge, implemented in C#.

Challenge Description:
The challenge consists of implementing several essential functions of the Git version control system from scratch, such as initialization, commits, logging, verification, and more. The goal is to understand the inner workings of Git and develop advanced low-level programming skills.

Challenge Status
 | 100% Completed
 | Only about 10% of participants manage to complete all stages

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

Pure C# implementation, <b>no existing Git libraries used too</b>

Manual reading and writing of the .git file system

Coding Git objects (blob, tree, commit) from scratch

Handling SHA-1 trees and zlib compression

Automated testing provided by CodeCrafters

ðŸŽ¯ Also my learnings:

Deep dive into the inner workings of Git

Manipulation of binary files and data structures

Optimizing code to improve performance and readability

ðŸš€ Why this challenge?
As a backend developer specializing in C# and .NET, I wanted to test my knowledge by taking on a low-level challenge that would push me out of my comfort zone. This experience not only taught me a lot about Git, but also strengthened my command of the language.
